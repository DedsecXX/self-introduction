https://github.com/Dedsec-Xu/DatasetImgLabel-ICDAR2015


LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool. Developed using Qt C++ and Python.

The users can use this gui software to make ICDAR 2015 format dataset simply by dragging.

It also implemented a ML model to detect words in the scene. The reported results on ICDAR2013 are:

|Model|totalM|totalN|totalK|Recall|Precision|H-mean|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|PixelLink|1095|1090|704|64.30%|64.587%|64.44%|

## Rubik’s Cube Robot
https://youtu.be/lwa5qByJMJc?t=164

Rubik’s Cube Robot is a project that I worked on in Sophomore year. It is capable of solving any rubix cube in 3 seconds.
A FPGA board serves as the Lower machine, which controls rotors by generating PWM waves.
A cellphone serves as the Upper machine. It calculates the formula and control the FPGA board via Bluetooth.
I led a 3-men team to finish this project.

## ROS+LiDAR Robot
https://github.com/Dedsec-Xu/LiDAR_ros_Robot

The robot is based on STM32 MCU and raspberry pie.
It can navigate to IoT devices and charge them wirelessly. The charge strategy is based on WIFI information exchange and Greedy Algorithm.
I led a 5-men team to finish this project in 2 weeks.
This project won third place in the TI cup competition.
